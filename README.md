API : https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/

## Overview Page:
The project starts by downloading everything from the online API, this can take a few seconds. Once you see all the characters you can select one and see their details via the Show Details button. Next to that you can switch to a local repository that contains a part of the online API included in this tool. With the "Back To Overview" button, you can go back to the current screen at any time.

You can always switch back to the Online API by pressing the same button which gets updated everytime it is pressed.
