API : https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/

Usage:
Overview Page:
The project starts by downloading everything from the online API, this can take a few seconds. Once you see all the characters you can select one and see their details via the Show Details button. Next to that you can switch to a local repository that contains a part of the online API included in this tool. With the "Back To Overview" button, you can go back to the current screen at any time.

On top of the overview page you can search for a specific character, by default is searches by name but using the dropdown left of the searchbar you can select a different searchcriterea. By pressing the Search button right of the bar your searchciteria are applied and you get a sorted list of characters.

Character Detail Page:
Once a character is selected you can see different pieces of information. In this page you can select various things: an episode or a location. By selecting a location and pressing "Show Details" you are taken to the Location Detail Page. For the episodes you are taken to the Episode Detail Page.


Location Detail Page:
This shows bit of information about the location and a list of all the residents of the selected location. By selecting a character you go back to the Character Detail Page.

Episode Detail Page:
This page shows a bit of information about the episode and a list of all the characters appearing in the selected episode. Again, selecting a character takes you back to their Detail Page.

Switching To Local Repository:
By switching to a local repository your current page gets updated and gives the information available in the local repository, if your selected location/episode/character is not in the local repository, a default page is shown instead. You can always switch back to the Online API by pressing the same button which gets updated everytime it is pressed.
